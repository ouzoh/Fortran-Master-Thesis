Estimation of *pVT* virial coefficients from Acoustic Measurements

#### Abstract

The aim of this project is to find an alternative route for determining the second virial coefficient, B, and its densities, ρ, from acoustic measurements. *pVT* measurements is the most common method for determining *B* and *ρ*, however this method is subject to large errors at low temperatures, T, due to absorption, which affects the amount of substance, n, and hence the accuracy of *pVT* measurements. Acoustic measurements on the other hand do not have an absorption problem and can be related to *pVT* virial coefficients through a differential equation. This project will also explore the alternative routes of measurements and the methods for solving the differential equation.

KEY WORDS: Acoustic virial coefficients, densities, Lagrange interpolation method, Taylor series, Intermolecular forces
